# jquery.hijack

This jquery plugin allows links and forms to be "ajaxified" so that their default get/post behaviour is replaced with ajax calls. The returned content is then injected into the target container.

## Installation

Include script *after* the jQuery library (unless you are packaging scripts somehow else):

<script src="/path/to/jquery.hijack.js"></script>
